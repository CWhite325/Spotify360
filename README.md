Spotify360
==========

A C++ App that can use Xbox 360 controllers to control Spotify

Has a Veto system to change tracks. Displays the currently playing track and can control volume from the Player 1 controller.

Can spin up the program at any time!

1. Connect Xbox 360 Controllers(Xbox One Controllers untested)
2. Open Spotify and choose your playlist
3. Use 'X' to veto, similar to Halo
4. Can also count a score of one every minute, a counter for a PowerHour of sorts


Needs some of refactor love.
Could also use a GUI.


Controls Spotify through Windows messaging.  

This has only been used and tested in Windows 7.
